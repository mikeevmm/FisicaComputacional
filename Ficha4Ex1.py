# Simulation of NIM game with one heap of maxpos peaces
# Rule: at each position, take 1, 2 or 3 pieces.
# Winner: the player that takes the last piece.

# Machine learning:
#   Play nr_games times against yourself and collect
#   statistics for winning and loosing positions,
#   in order to obtain best move for any position.
